# Tasklist
This is a small project on angular with a json database.

It's a task list that allow you to add a new task, display the list (with pagination, order, a searsh bar and the option to hide closed tasks) or to diplay a single task (and to delete or modify it). 

## Get started

Install your dependencies with `npm install` and then run your db with `json-server --watch db.json`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
